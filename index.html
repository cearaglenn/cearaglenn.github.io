									<h2>Work Experience</h2>
									<p>In my data science experience, I have worked quickly and efficiently in an agile environment to complete and deliver data science insights. Additionally, I have shifted between different industries (Retail, Communications, Transportation, Healthcare) within a role and learned those industries to provide relevant results to each sector and the data provided. I collaborate well with others and find ways to make our jobs more manageable on the day-to-day work. Overall, I can offer myself as a creative, inquisitive data scientist who is not afraid to learn new technologies, work quickly, and collaborate on a team to bring our best ideas. <br />
									<br /><strong>Below are a few examples of my contributions to various projects:</strong> </p>
								</header>
								<ul class="statistics">
									<li class="style1">
										As a software engineer and data scientist to create a customer service training solution using Watson Cloud Services and Natural Language Processing.
									</li>
									<li class="style2">
										I performed as a software developer to build reporter builders that will help developers' validate and improve their updates to existing software.
									</li>
									<li class="style3">
										I performed as a data scientist to create a classification algorithm for a retailer's products. This algorithm provided inventory recommendations that could produce sales up to 5%.
									</li>
